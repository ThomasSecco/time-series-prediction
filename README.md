# 📈 Time Series Prediction: Sales Forecasting

## 🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of time series forecasting techniques to predict sales trends over time. The repository showcases skills in:
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering (e.g., extracting date components).
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
- 🤖 **Model Training**: Leveraging ARIMA, Random Forest, and LSTM for forecasting.
- 📊 **Evaluation**: Using metrics like MAE and RMSE to assess model performance.
- 🔮 **Forecasting**: Predicting future sales and visualizing the results.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- 🐍 Python 3.8 or higher
- 📦 Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-prediction.git
    cd time-series-prediction
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Preprocess the Data
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
```bash
python src/data_processing.py
```


Here's an updated version of the script that uses emojis to make the README.md more visually appealing and removes the project structure section.
